<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>After working as a Radiation Therapist at Groote Schuur Hospital for several years, I have come to realise that my true passion lies in the field of technology, particularly web development.</p>

<p>My experience as a Radiation Therapist has equipped me with invaluable skills such as working with complex medical equipment, critical thinking, and problem-solving, which I believe will be a valuable asset as a Fullstack Web Developer.</p>

<p>I have taken a keen interest in the web development field and have familiarized myself with programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
